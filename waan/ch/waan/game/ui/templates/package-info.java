/**
 * This package provides a collection of pre-built UI components and templates.
 * <p>
 * The pre-built components are <i>not</i> designed for extension - most of them
 * are even implemented as final. Generally even the templates are <i>not</i>
 * designed for extension except for implementation of the abstract members.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The content of this package will be kept up to date with the most recent API
 * and core implementation. Minor behavioural changes may therefore occur
 * between versions. For component specific information the corresponding class
 * documentation should be consulted
 * </p>
