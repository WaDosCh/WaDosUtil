/**
 * Controller for a single high-level game state.
 * <p>
 * Scene Controllers are used to model a single high-level game state. Almost
 * always a game can be divided into a finite set of intrinsically different
 * states (e.g. main menu, main game view, pause screen, config screen) and a
 * finite set of possible transitions between these states. It is essential for
 * this model that all state transitions are initiated by the state that is
 * left. Therefore a state cannot be forced to give up its activity.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Although it not being a necessity for this model it is recommended to treat
 * state-internal data comparable to scope-limited (local) fields. I.e. it
 * should be avoided to be required to hold on to a left state. Adhesion to this
 * principle allows for a simpler state handling.
 * </p>
